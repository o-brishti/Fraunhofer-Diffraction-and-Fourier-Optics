# Applying Fourier Transforms to Diffraction Patterns
  
This project deals with the Applications of Fourier Transforms in different diffraction patterns. By simulating different aperture shapes (single slit, double slit, multi-slit, circular and other arbitrary shapes), we visualize how light interacts with obstacles, producing characteristic diffraction patterns.
